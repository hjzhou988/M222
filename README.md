# Algorithms in Bioinformaitcs
## Project Assignment 1 (PA1)
Paired-end sequencing reads aligning to 10kb region. Implemented BWT (Burrows-Wheeler Transformation) algorithm and hashing algorithm for quick mapping. Also detected false positive SNPs due to Indels.
## Project Assignment 2 (PA2)
Paired-end sequencing reads aligning to 1Mb region. Implemented Smith-Waterman algorithm for sequence alignment to detect Indels. Also detects STR (short tandem repeats).
## Homework
Solutions to the problems on Rosalind website. Including Project Assignment 2 (PA3) to solve the sequence assembly problem.
